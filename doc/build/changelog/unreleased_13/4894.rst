    Added DDL support for "computed columns"; these are DDL column
    specifications for columns that have a server-computed value, either upon
    SELECT (known as "virtual") or at the point of which they are INSERTed or
    UPDATEd (known as "stored").  Support is established for Postgresql, MySQL,
    Oracle SQL Server and Firebird. Thanks to Federico Caselli for lots of work
    on this one.
